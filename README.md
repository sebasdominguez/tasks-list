## Scope

This app has 2 main functions:

- Receive a certain number of tasks from an external [API](https://lorem-faker.vercel.app/): in this case we will have the option to decide how many tasks to receive and update its status.

- Create our own list of tasks: with the use of a DB we can create, update and delete tasks.

## Start Point

- Clone the repo
- Open a terminal on the root and run 'docker-compose up --build'
- Enjoy it...
